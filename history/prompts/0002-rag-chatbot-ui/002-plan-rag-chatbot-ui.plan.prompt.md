/sp.plan now planning of a rag chatbot which is in specs folder

## Response snapshot

I have created the `plan.md` and `research.md` files for the RAG chatbot UI feature. The `plan.md` outlines the technical approach and project structure. The `research.md` lists the open questions that require your input. Please review the `research.md` file and provide the necessary clarifications for the following points: Storage for conversation history, Testing framework, Performance goals, Constraints, and Scale and scope.
