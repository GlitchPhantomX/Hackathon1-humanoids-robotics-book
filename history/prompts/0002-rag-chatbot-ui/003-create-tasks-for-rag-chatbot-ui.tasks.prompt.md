## Prompt

/sp.tasks now create a tasks on rag chatbot

## Response snapshot

I have generated the `tasks.md` file with a detailed implementation plan for the RAG Chatbot UI feature. The tasks are organized by phases, from setup to polish, and broken down by user stories. You can find the generated file at `specs/002-rag-chatbot-ui/tasks.md`.

Total tasks: 24
Tasks per user story:
- US1: 3
- US2: 4
- US3: 5
- US4: 3

The plan includes parallel opportunities and an incremental delivery strategy. The MVP is defined as the completion of User Story 1: Structure.
