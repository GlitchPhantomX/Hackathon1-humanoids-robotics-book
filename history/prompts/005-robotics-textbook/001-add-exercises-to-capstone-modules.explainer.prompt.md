# Add Exercises to Capstone Modules

## Summary

Completed implementation task to add exercises to all capstone module documentation files in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. Verified that exercises were already present in the following files:

- 01-project-overview.md
- 02-architecture.md
- 03-voice-system.md
- 04-navigation.md (contains system integration content)
- 05-manipulation.md
- 06-integration.md

Updated the tasks.md file to mark these tasks as completed (T107-T112).

## Changes Made

- Updated tasks.md to mark exercises tasks as completed ([X] instead of [ ])
- Validated that exercises were already properly implemented in all specified files
- Verified content followed the required template structure

## Technical Details

The capstone module files already contained comprehensive exercises sections with:
- Multiple exercises per chapter (2-6 exercises)
- Proper exercise templates with objectives, requirements, deliverables, and test commands
- Appropriate difficulty levels and time estimates
- Context-appropriate content for humanoid robotics applications

## Outcome

All specified tasks for adding exercises to capstone modules have been validated as completed. The documentation already contained well-structured exercises that meet the requirements outlined in the specification.
