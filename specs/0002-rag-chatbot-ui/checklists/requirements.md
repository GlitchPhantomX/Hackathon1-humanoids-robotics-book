- [ ] Edge cases are identified
    *   *Need to add a dedicated section for edge cases in the spec.*
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
