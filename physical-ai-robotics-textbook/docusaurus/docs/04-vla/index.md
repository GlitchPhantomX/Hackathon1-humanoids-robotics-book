# <h1 className="main-heading">VLA: Voice-to-Action Systems</h1>
<div className="underline-class"></div>

This module explores Voice-to-Action (VLA) systems that enable humanoid robots to understand and respond to human voice commands. You'll learn how to integrate large language models (LLMs) and speech recognition to create natural human-robot interaction.
