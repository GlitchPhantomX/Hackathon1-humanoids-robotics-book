# VLA: Voice-to-Action Systems

This module explores Voice-to-Action (VLA) systems that enable humanoid robots to understand and respond to human voice commands. You'll learn how to integrate large language models (LLMs) and speech recognition to create natural human-robot interaction.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Implement speech recognition systems for humanoid robots
- Integrate large language models for command interpretation
- Create action planning systems based on voice commands
- Design natural language interfaces for robot control
- Implement multimodal input processing (voice + vision)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed the previous modules (Introduction, ROS 2, Simulation, Isaac)
- Understanding of natural language processing concepts
- Experience with API integration
- Basic knowledge of machine learning frameworks

## Module Overview

This module covers:
1. Introduction to Voice-to-Action Systems
2. Speech Recognition and Processing
3. Large Language Model Integration
4. Command Interpretation and Planning
5. Multimodal Interaction Systems
6. Voice Interface Design Patterns
